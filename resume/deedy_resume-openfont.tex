% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.

\descript{PROJECT OPENPAAS::NG}
The goal of this project is to design a  open-source entreprise social network providing a suite of
peer-to-peer collaborative office applications.
The aim is to offer a reliable and free alternative to existing solutions such as Google Apps.
This project is a joint work with the team DaSciM (Data Science and Mining) from the
computer science laboratory from the Ecole Polytechnique, Linagora, XWiki SAS and Nexedi.
\\
In this project, the COAST team works on topics such as the interorganisational federation of
peer-to-peer systems and the securing of communications in this kind of collaboration.
Furthermore, the team provides its expertise
on eventually consistent data replication mechanisms in distributed systems.
\\
In order to validate them, these works have been integrated in \href{https://www.coedit.re}{\customboldlink{MUTE}},
the demonstration platform of the team.
\begin{tightemize}
\item Maintaining of \emph{LogootSplit}\cite{sp2-l2-9}\cite{sp2-l2-10} implementation
\item Study of the literature on Conflict-free Replicated Data Types and of their use cases.
\item Development and integration of an anti-entropy mechanism\cite{sp2-l2-2}
\end{tightemize}

\descript{ADT INRIA PLM}
\href{http://people.irisa.fr/Martin.Quinson/Teaching/PLM/}{\customboldlink{The PLM}}
is a open-source programming exerciser.
Developped by Gérald Oster and Martin Quinson, this application proposes to students
to explore and to learn several concepts of the algorithmics through interactive and graphical exercises.
\\
The goal of this project was to enhance this tool in an experimental platform dedicated
to the teaching of computer science.
To achieve this, a usage data collecting mechanism was required in order to generate a dataset.
This dataset, made available to researchers, allows the realisation of research works on topics
such as the design of an automatic helping tool which tailors error messages to students.
A second objective of this project was to port the application, until then released as
a heavy Java software, into a web application to make it available to the greatest number.
\\
My works focused mainly on the realisation of that port.
This major change of paradigm introduced several problematics which needed to be adressed.
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Implementation and testing of the usage data collecting mechanism
    \item Conception and integration of a distributed architecture ensuring the scalability of the application
    \item Isolation of the execution of student code using containers
    \item Deployment and monitoring of a multi-components application

\descript{Design of a collaborative editing tool}
Coming from the research on collaborative editing, a new family of data replication and consistency maintenance algorithms
was recently formalised : the Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) approach.
This new family addresses several unresolved issues from other approaches, especially its scalability.
\\
The COAST team proposed a new algorithm from this family : \emph{LogootSplit}.
\\
In order to illustrate and highlight the team's works on this new approach,
my task was to design and implement a new real time collaborative editing tool based on this algorithm.
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implementation of \emph{LogootSplit} as a library
\item Design and development of \href{https://www.coedit.re}{\customboldlink{MUTE}}, a real time collaborative editing web app using this library
\end{tightemize}

\descript{Development of a tool to check the correctness of collaborative editing algorithms}
Existing collaborative editing tools relies mostly on a specific family of algorithms
to ensure the eventual consistency of copies : the operational transformation.
\\
Two consistency properties \emph{TP1} and \emph{TP2} are defined and allow to ensure the correctness of algorithms from this family.
\\
The goal of this internship was to develop a tool to automatically check the respect of these properties for a given algorithm.
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implementation of several algorithms from the operational transformation family
\item Development of the tool allowing to check if the algorithms ensure \emph{TP1} and \emph{TP2}
